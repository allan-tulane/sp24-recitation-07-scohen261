**2) The work of reachable , assuming $n$ nodes and $m$ edges is O(m + n). We visit each node and each edge exactly once.

**4) The worst case number of times to call reachable to determine if a graph is connected is once.

**5) The work of connected is also O(m + n).

**7) In the case of an adjacency matrix, assessing connectivity requires traversing each entry in the matrix. This process has a work of O(n^2). This is because we need to check both existing and non-existing edges, expanding the computational workload beyond just the existing edges.
